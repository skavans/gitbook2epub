# GitBook2EPUB

This is a simple tool for parsing GitBook online books into EPUB offline ones.
It tries to preserve the navigation structure (mostly), text formatting, links, codeblocks and images.

The software is provided as is. I developed it for my own purpose and tested it only on a very few gitbooks.
If you want to add/fix something â€“ feel free to submit pull requests.
